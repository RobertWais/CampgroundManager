# CampgroundManager
This application is the project for my independent study. 

The application will be used to manage the grounds of a campground. Campground Manager will allow employees
to see individually tasks that must be completed and for managers to delegate tasks. The app uses an image of the campground
with SVG layers ontop of it to show which sections of the campground have tasks associated with them. 

I wanted to create this application because throughout the five summers I had worked at Indian Trails Campground 
there was constant miscommunication between employees. This app would allow better communication, and save 
wasted time trying to find the next task to do outside. I am not only excited to create this because I am very interested in 
iOS development but I will also be solving a real problem with an application that I have made.

I also have received an Innovation Grant for reaching out to a professor and trying to create an original application
to solve a problem that I had identified.
